In software development, testing refers to the process of evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it behaves as expected 
and meets specified requirements. The primary goal of testing is to identify defects or bugs in the software so that they can be fixed 
before the software is released to users.
========================================
There are several types of testing performed throughout the software development lifecycle, including:

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of the software in isolation to ensure they function correctly.

Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or modules to ensure they work together as expected.

System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software from the perspective of end-users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

Regression Testing: Re-running tests on previously tested parts of the software to ensure that changes or fixes haven't introduced new defects.

Performance Testing: Testing the performance and responsiveness of the software under different conditions, such as varying loads or network speeds.

Security Testing: Testing the software for vulnerabilities and weaknesses to ensure it is secure against unauthorized access or attacks.
===========================================================================================================
Definition and Principles:
Behavior-Driven Development is an evolution of Test-Driven Development (TDD) that focuses on the expected behavior of the software 
from a user's perspective.
=====================================================
TDD involves writing tests before code to drive development at the unit level, focusing on code behavior. 
BDD emphasizes collaboration and understanding of system behavior from a user's perspective, 
using structured specifications to drive development. TDD focuses on testing individual units, 
while BDD tests the system's behavior as a whole.

Popular Framework for Testing:
1)X Unit
2)N Unit
3)MS Testing
